    "# Activity 1.02: Teaching the Agent to Realize Situations When It Defends Against Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will force the computer to defend against a loss if the player puts their third sign in a row, column, or diagonal line:\n",

    "  > **Hints**  \n",
    "  >  1. Reuse all the code from Steps 1â€“5 from the Exercise 1.03.\n",
    "  >  2. Create a function called `player_can_win` that takes all the moves from the board using the `all_moves_from_board` function and iterates over it using a variable called `next_move`. On each iteration, it checks whether the game can be won by the sign, and then it returns `True` or `False`.\n",
    "  >  3. Extend the AI's move so that it prefers making safe moves. A move is safe if the opponent cannot win the game in the next step.\n",
    "  >  4. Test the new application. You will find that the AI has made the correct move.\n",
    "  >  5. Place this logic in the state space generator and check how well the computer player is doing by generating all possible games.\n",
